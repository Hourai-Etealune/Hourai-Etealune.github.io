I't kinda useless at level 1 or 2, and normally you must work to get it to level 3, which you need either 3 of this, or combine it with Darling & Honey card. If you manage to do that, You'll get a 1000 HP bonus, which is quite big. This Card scored lower than Darling&Honey mainly because it's using Armor slot, where you can have many other good card abilities compared with what you can use at necklace.\n\n  \n\n![](images/70040020iris_l.png)\n\n  \n**Darling & Honey**\n\n  \nRarity: Super Rare\n\n  \nPosition: Chest\n\n  \nAttributes\n\nNone\n\nRelease Ability\n\nR0\n\nR1\n\nR2\n\nR3\n\nR4\n\n[Affection](http://hourainingyou.blogspot.com/2011/05/emil-chronicle-online-release-ability.html#affection)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nRating: ★★★★★★★★★\n\nSame with Urd & Collins, this card will raise your [Affection](http://hourainingyou.blogspot.com/2011/05/emil-chronicle-online-rele%60se-ability.html#affection) abilities by 30 at R0, which is you get a level 2 Release ability just using this card.
