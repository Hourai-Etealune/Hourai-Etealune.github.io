In The Y sector, there's a cylinder enclosure (which also has dbE written on it). for the bud, the outer layer is made from steel, not a cheaply chromed plastic like many others done. In the connection between bud and cord, there's a small writing that symbolize L/R , which represents which bud enter which ear. the driver is protected with metalic grill and not replaceable.  </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/63508af0a7aa717eb1c053a40973a5a6/41689/IEM.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;

I can tell from where the sound is coming but I can't tell how far/near it is compared to the other instrument.  </p>\n<p>Bass: good, coloured, not tight enough, but very fun to be listened,I love this point &#x3C;3, It enters bass section a bit too early, though, so if someone is playing guitar bass the mid will be overwhelmed by it.  </p>\n<p>Mid: I separate this into 2 section, Higher mid and lower mid. The lower mid is overwhelmed by bass, and the higher mid is kind of sharp and edgy.  </p>\n<p>Treble: smooth, but since treble is usually following high mid, it's not as good as it is.  </p>\n<p>Detail : Mediocre, I'd say. The lower mid are overwhelmed by bass, but after that it's quite good.  </p>\n<p>and that's before it's burned in. after burning in there's a significant change:  </p>\n<p>The bass become more punchy, not bloated at all, it knows where the bass are supposed to be.<br>\nMids become smoother, the edgy sound in the higher mid is smoother, and since the bass were not bloated anymore, lower mid is not being overwhelmed.<br>\nIt's treble now pack quite a lot of detail, a bit analytic but that's fine. I love analytic sound (my ER6, long gone)  </p>\n<p>When paired with Fiio E5 (headphone amp);if without bass boost I'd say this thing will sound worse. It's like this thing will have cuted bitrate (downgrade in detail). If you use the bass boost, this will make the bass crazier, which i find it to be too much. I prefer unamped much better.  </p>\n<p>Overall, this is a really good IEM considering i't only about USD 20$'s, while not perfect (Nothing does, IMO) this IEM will crush most item below 50$ mark. It's worth of an item that you can call it steal.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Review: dbE Acoustic PR18","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2009-01-21-review-dbe-acoustic-pr18/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-01-21-review-dbe-acoustic-pr18/","layout":"post"}}
