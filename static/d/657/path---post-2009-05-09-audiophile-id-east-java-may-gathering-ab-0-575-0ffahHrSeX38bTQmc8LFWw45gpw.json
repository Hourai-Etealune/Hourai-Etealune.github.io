Off topic note, I&#8217;m still unsure what kind of blog this blog will be. Some friends suggests that I should make this blog reviewing about Touhou music, well, that&#8217;s not a bad idea, since funkies is broken and nowhere to be found. I&#8217;ll try to make some, and see how well it goes.<br /></span>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Audiophile-id   East Java  – May gathering-"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-05-09-audiophile-id-east-java-may-gathering/"}}
