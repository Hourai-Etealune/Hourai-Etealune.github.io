{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Actually, I still like my previous layout, but since I have nothing to do then I’ll do something about it, for the sake of “Having something to do” :P. Also, a bit of tutorial on how to make the “continue reading” section on blogspot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i485.photobucket.com/albums/rr211/Hourai/myblog/25f10b80b8299fcdb8e895ca9164874d.jpg\"> </p>\n<p><span><a name='more'></a><br />This change mainly revolves around new themes, and also using this “Continue Reading…” things, here’s how to do it.</p> </p>\n<p>\n  1. Enter your blogger accounts.<br />2. Go to the Dashboard, from there, go to the Layout tabs &#8211; > Edit HTML<br />3. Expand Widget Templates (just tick the button with corresponding names)<br />4. Find this line of codes in your template HTML:<br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small\"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <data:post.body/><br /></span><br />5. As you might guessed, this is the content of your post, now we want to modify this so that only a paragraph (or I dunno how many amount of contents you prefer) is being shown on the outside.<br />For the sake of easiness, just replace that line with<br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small\"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:if cond=&#8217;data:blog.pageType == &#8220;item&#8221;&#8216;> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<style>.fullpost{display:inline;}</style> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><data:post.body/></p> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b:else/> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<style>.fullpost{display:none;}</style> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><data:post.body/> </p><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><a expr:href=&#8217;data:post.url&#8217;><b>Continue Reading&#8230;</b></a></p> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b:if><br /></span>\n</p>\n<p>\n  6. Done? Now save your template.<br />7. Go to the Settings tab -> Formatting, there you will find something like textbox labeled &#8220;Post template&#8221; in the lower section.<br />8. Write these following codes there.<br /><span style=\"font-size: x-small\"><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=&#8221;fullpost&#8221;> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> <br /></span><br />9. Save it&#8230;..\n</p>\n<p>\n  10 Ok, It&#8217;s done, now what left is about how to use this code. Simply place the first paragraph above the <span style=\"font-size: x-small\"><span class=&#8221;fullpost&#8221;></span> (this should be automatically there if you&#8217;re following section numer 7-9, else write it yourself) and the rest of contents below that line and above <span style=\"font-size: x-small\"></span></span>;\n</p>\n<p>\n  Why I&#8217;m using it? well, the most obvious reason is because I used a lot of picture (and I&#8217;m also aware that there are many ppl who don&#8217;t have decent Internet speed to load all the picture while trying to browse specific contents). The other reason is&#8230; you know, simplicity, no one wants to scroll the sea of text or pics to view what&#8217;s posted here.\n</p>\n<p>\n  That&#8217;s about it, and as you can see, I&#8217;m not done with Layouting yet (This themes only serves as placeholder), Well, yeah, I guess now It&#8217;s photoshopping time&#8230;&#8230;<br /></span>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Layout change."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-07-07-layout-change/","layout":"post"}}
