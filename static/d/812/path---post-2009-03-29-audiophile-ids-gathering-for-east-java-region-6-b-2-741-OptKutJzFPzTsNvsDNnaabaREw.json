{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This week is the last week before mid-term exam. I have many things on my mind, aside from many assignment that makes Me get inadequate sleep (sleeping at 3 in the morning, wake up at 6). Anyway, even though I’m quite busy, I, fortunately, get a chance to attend the audiophile-id’s 2nd gathering for East Java’s region. <a href=\"http://www.audiophile-id.com/\">Audiophile-id</a> is an Indonesian’s audiophile forum specializing in headphone audio(Just imagine it as smaller version of <a href=\"http://www.head-fi.org/\">Head-fi</a>, for Indonesian).</p>\n<p>So what do I listen there… well, several cans,IEMs,and Buds, which mostly a good one (and a bit pricey as well, 100$++ for each pair of it, might sounds very expensive for non audiophile), but fortunately I’m not getting attached to them, well, except iBasso D2 Viper amps.</p>\n<p><a name='more'></a></p>\n<p>Cans:<br>\nAKG K400EP<br>\nAKG K412P<br>\nAudio Technica A500<br>\nAudio Technica A900<br>\nAudio Technica EM7 GM<br>\nCrossroad Bijou #2<br>\ndbE HF30<br>\ndbE PR18<br>\ndbE PR20<br>\nSennheiser HD414 , Kimber Recabled<br>\nSennheiser HD555<br>\nSennheiser PX100<br>\nUltimate Ears Super fi. 5 EB<br>\nUltrasone Proline 750<br>\nWestone UM1<br>\nWestone UM2<br>\nYuin PK2</p>\n<p>Cable:<br>\nCardas Mini2Mini<br>\nCardas LOD with BG caps</p>\n<p>Source:<br>\niPod Classic 160 Gb<br>\niPod iMod Video 5th gen<br>\niPod Nano 4th Gen<br>\niPod Shuffle 2nd Gen<br>\niPod Video 5,5gen<br>\nSandisk sansa Clip<br>\nSony Walkman NWZ-A726F<br>\nSony Walkman NWZ-B135F<br>\nZen Stone plus</p>\n<p>Amps:<br>\nFiio E5<br>\niBasso D2 Boa<br>\niBasso D2 Viper<br>\nDIY Desktop Amp</p>\n<p>Aside from my own rig.. which is<br>\nSennheiser MX160(earbuds), dbE PR18(IEM), Etymotic ER4S(IEM), Zigis CMoy amp w/ OPA2134 (Amplifier), FiiO E3(Amplifier).</p>\n<p>I’m quite impressed with the D2 Viper, which sounds extremely good when paired with my Etymotics. To said, that’s far more better than my own Zigis amp. On the other side, other members claims that my Zigis is far better than Viper. Well, in my etymotics, Zigis cuts off the detail which I’m looking for, while adding more bass (This is not the case for their fullsize, It’s just the etymotics that’s really sensitive in detail, OPA2134 in Zigis supposedly give more detail, but when your cans have higher standard than that, it will just cut off the detail)</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i485.photobucket.com/albums/rr211/Hourai/llkodlpfq3k39isrnbh2-1.jpg\"><br>\nMembers of East Java Reg.

I’m not even interested in Proline 750. People who likes Zigis above is a perfect example of this. I’m considering to get D2 Viper for myself, my friend got it for less than 100$. The problem is that I don’t have that much money to spend yet, and I can’t find it as easily as other items. That’s it, if I can’t afford this before July, I think I will make amps myself (might be CMoy, or PIMETA, if I can find place where I can buy the parts, PPA is out of my ability).</p>\n<p>For now, it’s exam!!!!! I will take 4 exam straight without break this Tuesday (Software Engineering, Numerical Method, Artificial Intelligence, and Database).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Audiophile-Id’s Gathering for East Java region."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-03-29-audiophile-ids-gathering-for-east-java-region/"}}
