This is actually kinda correct, since if you go to single direction, you will be looped back to the previous block. The Desert is actually consist of 9 maps in 3×3 formation, with the same looking terrain, but have different monster, and a landmark such as camp in block 4.</span><br>\n<span><br /></span><span>If you’re lost, You can kind of guess where you are by going checking the monsters and or simply go east/left until the maps make sense. Sand worm can spawn anywhere in 9 areas, so it’ll be tough to look for him. Regarding monsters, ghost and mummy will only appear at night (obviously). The game will rotate in the order of 4 days – dusk – 4 night , just go back and forth the portal if you want to get into night/day according your preference.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regards,</span><br>\n<span>~Hourai Etealune~ </span></p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Carmine Brick Desert Map","url":"/blog/carmine-brick-desert-map/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2013-08-25-carmine-brick-desert-map/","layout":"post"}}
