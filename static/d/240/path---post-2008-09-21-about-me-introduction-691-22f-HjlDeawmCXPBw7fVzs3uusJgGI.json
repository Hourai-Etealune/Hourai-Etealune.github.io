Also… Please by any mean call me Hourai, i hate to be called by my real name on the Internet as much as many of you do.<br>\nCurrently Living in Indonesia and attending a college called iSTTS (institut Sains Terapan dan Teknologi Surabaya). Specifically, I’m attending it’s Informatics Technology.<br>\nI have Interest in Anime, Game,and some other thing. For anime, I mainly watch Action and Drama (as of late, I don’t watch anything because there’s nothing good to watch). For game… I played a lot of things and enjoy them all, except sports game… For my favorite game now, it’s the Touhou Series (for you who don’t know what is this, i will make a post for this later…)</p>\n<p>Well, that’s it for now.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me: introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008-09-21-about-me-introduction/"}}
