I&#x2019;m paying for it since it helps me with quite a lot of game, not just ECO. This program is great if you play international server game and get disconnected out of nothing but your internet is actually fine (for me, it&#x2019;s Mabinogi and PSO2). Just apply for their account creation page and download the program.</span></p> \n  \n  <p>\n    2. Japanese proxy server (not vpn, but can also be used), or working tsunagarumon.<br>You can use either one, proxy/tsunagarumon is only needed to login the browser page, after that, you may turn it off.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p>\n    And that&#x2019;s it, now for how to connect:<br>1. Install WTFAST, should be straightforward, use your email/password combination to login into WTFAST&#x2019;s program. You&#x2019;ll get 30 days subscription for free at first.<br>2. If you can use Tsunagarumon, let it connect and skip to step 8, otherwise, use proxy in step 3.<br>3. You will need japanese proxy to get through japanese eco&#x2019;s website. There&#x2019;s many you can use but usually they died in several hours/day so you must change them daily. To get proxy address, use this website to look for one <a href=\"http://www.getproxy.jp/japan\">http://www.getproxy.jp/japan</a>. in this page, you&#x2019;ll need to find the one that use http/https(SSL) connection.<br>\n  </p>\n  \n  <div style=\"clear: both;text-align: center\">\n    <span><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D-NBuOVfxLg/UNHvSezHkDI/AAAAAAAABZ4/_aY7Rj7VJbM/s1600/proxylist.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;margin-right: 1em\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"433\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D-NBuOVfxLg/UNHvSezHkDI/AAAAAAAABZ4/_aY7Rj7VJbM/s640/proxylist.png\" width=\"640\"></a></span>\n  </div>\n  \n  <p>\n    <span><br>4.
