{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Well, to put it simply, I'm bored. <br>\nSince I have a bit of time in my hand, I decided to extract ECOjp and get the ex motion data and integrate it to our ECOid. It's a shame that we'll get it at saga 14, which may take roughly 2 years from now on.  </p>\n<p>Note that what I'm doing is pretty much illegal... or not. The link for rule page is broken when I'm creating this so I'll consider it's not illegal when making this since there's no rule stated that it is :D . Nevertheless I can't share how to do it with you guys. Sorry bout that.  </p>\n<p>Regards,<br>\n~Hourai Etealune~</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"[ECO] EX Motion","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2012-07-15-eco-ex-motion/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-07-15-eco-ex-motion/","layout":"post"}}
