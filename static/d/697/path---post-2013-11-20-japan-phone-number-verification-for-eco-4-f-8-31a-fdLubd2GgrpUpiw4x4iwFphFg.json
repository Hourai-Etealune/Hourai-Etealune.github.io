The most obvious workaround is to ask Japanese people you know (or anyone who live there) to verify it for you.  </p>\n<p> Compulsory unrelated picture</p>\n<p>However, not everyone have friend in Jp which force them to either abandon their ID to create a new one or retiring. There is a way, though might a bit pricy, to make your id verified. You can contact/mail a char named 敏郎 in Zinnia to verify it. Of course, it's not free. He ask for 50 million gold (zinnia) or USD 15$, whichever you can afford to save your ID. You can mail him or whisp him if you need his service (please write in English).  </p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Japan Phone Number Verification for ECO","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2013-11-20-japan-phone-number-verification-for-eco/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2013-11-20-japan-phone-number-verification-for-eco/","layout":"post"}}
