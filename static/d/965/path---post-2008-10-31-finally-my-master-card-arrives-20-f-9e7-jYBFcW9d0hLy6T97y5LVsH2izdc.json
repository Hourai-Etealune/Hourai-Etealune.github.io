And no, I won't load cash to my card soon, since the exchange rate for USD has been crazy lately.  </p>\n<p>The reason I applied this card is for activating <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com/\">Paypal</a> and to buy things aboard. Before, I used my parent's Visa card to get things I want to buy (I don't have one myself, poor me >.&#x3C;). As of now, I'm living in separated city, so, borrowing their card is no longer an option for me. That's why I'm looking one that don't need any requirements to apply (you need to have a decent income/ parent's approval to get a Credit Card, which I have none of them. My parents against me having a credit card).  </p>\n<p>Why do I compare this card with a credit card? Ok, screw this thing. The only thing I need is their \"MasterCard\" ability. For your information, there's no debit card in my country that support either Visa/Visa Electron/MasterCard. You must have credit card to have the service. So basically, I can't buy anything outside my country unless i have credit card on my hand. On the other hand, this payoneer card is a debit card and it has MasterCard ability, so this thing will make me able to buy things outside my country without having a debit card.  </p>\n<p>PS: My parents don't know that now I have this card on my hand.... If they read this, then I'm screwed :/me running away~:</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Finally, My Master Card Arrives","url":null,"date":"2008-10-31"},"fields":{"path":"/post/2008-10-31-finally-my-master-card-arrives/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008-10-31-finally-my-master-card-arrives/","layout":"post"}}
