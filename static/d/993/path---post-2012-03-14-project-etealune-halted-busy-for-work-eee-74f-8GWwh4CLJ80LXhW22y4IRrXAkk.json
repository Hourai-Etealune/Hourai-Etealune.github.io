The reason i use this motion is becauseÂ  it have very minimal movement. My skirt physics is still far from adequate.</span><br>\n<span><br /></span></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align: center\">\n</div>\n<p><span></span><br>\n<a name='more'></a><span><br /></span><br>\n<span>2nd Trial:</span><br>\n<span>Full version of the above video, not much difference, just fixing physics and weight map, adding physics to my tail, etc.</span></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align: center\">\n</div>\n<p><span>3rd Trial:</span><br>\n<span>This time, I fully test the motion, camera, physics and such. Itâ€™s still incomplete though, I havenâ€™t develop any physics for hair, jabot, ribbon, and such (warning: it spins around quite much =3=)</span></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align: center\">\n</div>\n<p><span>Â  </span><br>\n<span>4th Trial:</span><br>\n<span>The last trial I manage to do. It combines the MMD with Augmented reality system. Due to my inexperience in messing around with 3D + AR, the physics is broken. Iâ€™m not really experienced about this kind of thing, and unfortunately I donâ€™t have time to work for it anymore due to the workload.</span></p>\n<div style=\"clear: both;text-align: center\">\n</div>\n<p><span>Â  </span><br>\n<span>Well, thatâ€™s about it.Â </span></p>\n<p><span>Currently I need to learn about Yii framework and WordPress for my job. While at it, thereâ€™s good chance Iâ€™ll make the Iris section using one of them (most likely WordPress). If you get any work, might as well make it fun, right ? ðŸ˜€</span><br>\n<span><br /></span><br>\n<span>Regards,<br />~Hourai Etealune~</span><br>\n<span></span><br>\n<span></span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Project Etealune Halted, busy for work :("}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-03-14-project-etealune-halted-busy-for-work/","layout":"post"}}
