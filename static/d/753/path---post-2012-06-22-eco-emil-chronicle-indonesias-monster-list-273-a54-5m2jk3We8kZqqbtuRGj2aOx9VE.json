If you don’t know it, just ignore it. It might be some unreleased monster in ECOid or some debug monster or whatever. If you don’t know what row mean what, feel free to ask me here. usually you just need to know 3-5 first row though.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: red\">*EDIT: someone reported to me all exp is double than it should be. I forgot that i take the data at the DE week or something. I have replaced the file with the current normal exp, you can redownload it.
