{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>It has been almost one year after the closing of Emil Chronicle Online. Truthfully, I am still sad about the ending. However, whatever happens, happens.

As for now, there is no game quite like ECO and I don't plan to play any game seriously until there is any decent replacement. That's why I plan to repurpose this blog to worship Hourai become my personal blog which covers these following things in no particular order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hourai</li>\n<li>More Hourai</li>\n<li>Even more Hourai</li>\n<li>Coding (from Web programming to Game programming, whichever I worked at the time)</li>\n<li>Reviews (mostly peripheral and/or new gadget/tech stuff)</li>\n<li>Design/Modeling (3D modeling, in particular)</li>\n<li>From time to time, I will rant here when I feel like it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There will be no fixed time when I will publish something, but I do plan to keep this blog alive. As the first step, I already move the server from Blogger to WordPress, mainly due to the availability of plugins that I will need to fulfill that purpose (I need those syntax highlighters, at the very least).</p>\n<p>That's all for now. As of now, I am busy with redecorating both the main page and this blog. Since I only have time in the night after work, it will be a sporadical update at best, but I ensure you that I will try to consistently improve this blog and my site in general. This site is where my Hourai resides, and I will not let it dies and becomes one of the dead corners of the internet.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Future of this blog","url":"/blog/futures-of-this-blog/","date":"31 July 2018"},"fields":{"path":"/post/2018-07-31-futures-of-this-blog/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018-07-31-futures-of-this-blog/","layout":"post"}}
