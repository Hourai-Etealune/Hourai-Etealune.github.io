For percentage increase, this won&#8217;t add weapons enchancement (Only pure weapon attack without it&#8217;s +). A Stronger weapon will yield more attack bonus, use it with a high end weapon (such as lv 99 weapon).

The reason this ability rated lower than Short range is because there&#8217;s only a few types of card which adds up Long range burst other than weapon. Sure, you can equip it on gun/arrow, but since it&#8217;s gunner/striker weapon and they have absolute attack skill, it&#8217;r kinda useless.

People would usually get this skill onto lv 3 (using 3 SR card), mainly because it adds up 1000HP with 3 R0 cards only (Basic health need at least 6 R4 card to get +800). with these, you can get a +1000 HP and many empty slot for another abilities. This is like a package version of several great abilities.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<p>–></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Emil Chronicle Online:  Release Ability Description"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2011-05-01-emil-chronicle-online-release-ability-description/"}}
