Normally i won't play this game since i already beat the PS2 one, but since Pleinair is coming out as playable character(I'm a fan of her), I will play this game until get bored again (hopefully, until I managed to beat Prinny Baal...). Oh, and I have my own rules on playing NIS's Title, that is, I will never use my main character at all (so yeah... leave it at level 1 without exp), I managed to do that with the other games(Disgaea2, Phantom Brave), I dunno if can do that with this one, in case Laharl are needed to have a certain level to unlock something.  </p>\n<p>Not bad so far...just have a nostalgic feeling of it. I also think that it may become a good time waster on my 1-week holiday. As for now, my top priority is to get Pleinair and to unlock anything that's not available in PS2 release, such as ending, weapon, etc.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Disgaea DS","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2008-09-24-disgaea-ds/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008-09-24-disgaea-ds/","layout":"post"}}
