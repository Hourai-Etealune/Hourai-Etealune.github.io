Make a party at arena with the bard inside</span><br>\n<span>2. Have the bard cast pop</span><br>\n<span>3. Immediately remove the bard from party</span><br>\n<span>4. Wait <u>until the music is over,</u> then invite the bard to rejoin the partyÂ Â </span><br>\n<span>5. Repeat from step 2.</span><br>\n<span><br /> </span><br>\n<span>And thatâ€™s it, the bonus should stack infinitely. Be warned that:</span><br>\n<span>1. You mustnâ€™t get any other buff, including HF, if your bard want to use HF, confirm that sheâ€™s outside the party</span><br>\n<span>2. If youâ€™re dead, and getting resurrected, the stat will go back to normal. This also applies to getting back to the savepoint. But thereâ€™s an exception that if you save at downtown and you get back to that position, the stat will not reset.</span><br>\n<span><br /></span><br>\n<span>Well thatâ€™s it, basically with this you can massacre a lot of ppl in arena, if you get enough time to prepare.</span></p>\n<p><span>Regards,</span><br>\n<span>~Hourai Etealune~<br /> </span></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"[ECO] getting godly stat bonus temporarily"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2012-06-07-eco-getting-godly-stat-bonus-temporarily/"}}
