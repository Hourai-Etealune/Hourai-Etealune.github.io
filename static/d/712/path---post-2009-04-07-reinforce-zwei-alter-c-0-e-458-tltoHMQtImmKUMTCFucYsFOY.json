I don't have any space to spend for these girl. It might be okay if I'm on my own house, but now I'm renting a room on some boarding house (I'm not originally from Surabaya). Adding more Action Figure to my room is pretty much same as adding more mess in my cramped, small room.  </p>\n<p>Previously, I'm almost losing hope of obtaining this Figure, but on some certain day last year, Sonicver2 notify me that Reinforce is going to be re-published. I immediately wake up, leave my bed, and making a pre-order.  </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I'm also glad that I miss the first batch of production, in this batch, they improve the painting, most noticeably on her cloth  </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/2009/04/Untitled-1-2.jpg\">\nThis is my unit, the previous batch have coarser painting on her cloth lining  </p>\n<p>That's for it, other than the painting it's more or less the same item.  </p>\n<p>PS: I never noticed this but, I think will get a tripod because...
