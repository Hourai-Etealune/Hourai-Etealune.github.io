As you can see, Katsuragi Misato one is -sorry- an extremely cheap item, He said He got it as bonus when he bought candy in Hongkong (dunno which brand he's talking about), and for Shidou Haruko, He bought it from kotobukiya, it's supposed to be a set of character, though, but He only get that one. I get both for free XD, so I won't give any complaint or whatsoever but Thanks.  </p>\n<p>As of now, He should have arrived there..... well, good luck for him there, I'm not sure I can contact him anymore though, since it's most likely that He will change his HP number. I myself is still on the holiday break in my hometown. I have no internet connection here, I'm writing this on my friend's PC.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"From My Friend","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2008-10-02-from-my-friend/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008-10-02-from-my-friend/","layout":"post"}}
