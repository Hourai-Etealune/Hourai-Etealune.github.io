I only give a picture i take as representative of what I'm writing at that time. So don't go mailing me about how bad my pic were taken (I get several regarding this blog...)  </p>\n<p>1. I'm using a Nikon Coolpix 5200, an old, pocket camera, which can easily be surpassed even by Handphone's built in camera. And no, I don't have SLR camera or such.  </p>\n<p>2. I'm only using photoshop just for rescaling and cropping the pic, the image itself is as is, and I'm not using any image enhancement to modify it. No brightness change, no noise reduction, etc.  </p>\n<p>Ok, that's it, I love to collect AF's but I have almost no interest in taking photo of that. I have almost no interest nor talent in photography to begin with.<br>\nMy blog is not the place where I post about photography, Just go somewhere else if you want it. This is not the place.</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Toymagz Fair : day one","url":null,"date":"2008-12-05"},"fields":{"path":"/post/2008-12-05-toymagz-fair-day-one/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2008-12-05-toymagz-fair-day-one/","layout":"post"}}
