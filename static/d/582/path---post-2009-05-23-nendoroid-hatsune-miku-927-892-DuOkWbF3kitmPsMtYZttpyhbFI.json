{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Normally, I don't do any photoshoot, nor even think about it. Well, this time it's a special case. My friend request me to do that, in exchange that I can get in touch with someone who sells this nendoroid Miku.  </p>\n<p>I've already warned him that I absolutely have no skill in this area, and he say \"just do it\" -_-a. Well, I can't argue with him. It's an easy thing in exchange for this nendoroid. that's to say, this is my first time doing this (and thanks to my friend, XPhile for lending me his tripod).  </p>\n<p>Since this is not my area of expertise, don't expect too much from me. If you do have any comment, feel free to do so. There might be more case that He will ask me to do something similar again, I don't know, also, if I can get more skill with this, why not? learning more never hurts.  </p>\n<p>On a side note, I'm using Nikon Coolpix 5200. I don't know but it's noise rate is far above average. I must set the ISO to 64 so that there won't be any visible noise.  </p>\n<p>Here you go:  </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/mikuonthestage.jpg\"><br>\nOn the concert stage.  </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/mikuserve3.jpg\"><br>\nNegi, anyone...?  </p>\n<p><img src=\"images/mikuleek1copy.jpg\">\n<img src=\"images/hachune.jpg\">\nHachune is a must... just a compulsory thing for miku. also, the other face I get....  </p>\n<p>And yeah.... Miku can be balanced even without any stander.  </p>\n<p>Well, that's it. I know this is not a good pic, since I'm not into this, but if you do comment on this, I'll try to make it better next time. Well then~</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"Nendoroid - Hatsune Miku","url":null},"fields":{"path":"/post/2009-05-23-nendoroid-hatsune-miku/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2009-05-23-nendoroid-hatsune-miku/","layout":"post"}}
