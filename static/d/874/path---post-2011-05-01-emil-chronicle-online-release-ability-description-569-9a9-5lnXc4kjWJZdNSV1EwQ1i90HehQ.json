An overwhelmingly high leveled enemies will make you get a penalty for hit rate, so even you get, like 120 dex, it will almost always miss.

At every odd level, this abilities will give you 3 left def boost, and 5% armor defense boost ad odd level. Note that this card is extremely useful only if you are tanker or at least hybrid with decent vit.

The reason this ability rated lower than Short range is because there's only a few types of card which adds up Long range burst other than weapon.
